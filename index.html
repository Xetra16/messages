Ey yow Escort here, HAHAHAHA. Eto lang ang gift ko sa’yo pasensya na. HAPPY BIRTHDAY SA BFF NAMING SECRETARY!! 
Alam naming mahirap ang ginagawa mo kaya tina-try kong tulungan ka in any way. Nung unang kita namin sa’yo ay napasabi na kami na, 
“Ay, magiging president to”. PERO DI NAMIN AKALAIN NA MAGIGING BFF KA PALA NAMIN. Lalo na’t kasa-kasama mo pa sila anes non (UY BAWAL MAGNAME DROP). 
Tiktok tiktok pa kayo sa likod non and sabi na lang ni Arnie ay, “Sanaol may friends” Unang week na nagging close tayo is yung groupings sa Oral Comm. 
Nahihiya pa kami sa’yo kasi si Lloyd lang naman kaclose namin ni Arnie. Akala ko nga di ka namamansin non eh T_T. 
Kaso umuwi ang ating BFF na si Arnie non kaya tayong dalawa na lang na magbff na pumunta sa Intra. 
AKALA KO MASUNGIT KA KASI PARANG YUNG AURA MO NON IS PARANG GALIT SAKIN T_T. Pero nakausap naman kita non nung uwian and you were not the person I expected. 
Hindi ka yung masungit na non-chalant kineme whatever HAHAHAHAHA.
<br>
<br>
Nung second week kasama natin si Lloyd, (tayo tayo pa magkakatabi non) and si Arnie is katabi si ate donna. 
Wala pa tayong kaalam alam sa issue nilang tatlo, Inosente pa tayo. Si Lloyd pa masyadong kinakausap non KASI NGA NAHIHIYA AKO SAYO DIBA HAHAHAHA. 
Tas nung nagkawatak watak na ang Barangay, dun na tayo naging close nila Arnie. I’m so grateful na nakilala ka namin and naging kaclose, 
kasi minomotivate mo kami sa mga subs HAHAHHA. And nung down na down tayo sa Komunikasyon, minotivate mo rin kami kahit bagsak tayong tatlo HAHAHAH. 
Bawi na lang sa Exam. Alam kong this week lang tayo naging close pero grabe na impact mo samin. Tahimik ako dati pero pag kasama ka nagiging energetic ako AHAHAH. 
Mas nagiging comfortable kami kapag kasama ka. Sus puro naman ako kwento, eto na yung totoong appreciation.
<br>
<br>
To our beloved secretary and Bff, you can do it, we know you can. Even if you are stressed on being a secretary, we’re here to help you. 
I know this doesn’t sound a lot but, as an escort, I’ll try to help you. On the attendance, on the announcement, we’re on this together. 
And as a bff, okay lang yan kahit nab-blackout ka tuwing quizzes. 
Tutulungan ka naman namin ni Arnie if hindi mo magets yung lessons. Lagot na lang if lahat tayo hindi gets yung lesson AHAHAHAH jokee.
<br>
<br>
Yun lang, Happy Birthday Sec! Enjoy your day!

Hii Sammmmm!!!
<br>
<br>
I just want to say that, thank you for being part of my 2023. 
I wish I had met you sooner and spend a lot of time together. 
I never thought that I would be the one boy that you chose. 
As time went by, I fell deeper and deeper into you. 
My Sam, you are so valuable to me that I wrote this message.
<br>
<br>
A precious girl who looks masculine, but is soft hearted inside. 
Likes McDonald's Fillet and craves for fried tofu. Eats cookies & cream almost every week. 
Very hardworking as a secretary. 
Looks masculine but loves the color pink. 
Crushes enemies on Mobile Legends but is too bored when playing alone.  
Watches stream all night so she often doesn't sleep. Loves doing discord calls as her love language. 
Loves plushies and always hugs them. Hugs pretty tight and is very clingy. 
Eyes shining like a bright star. A beautiful smile that show how happy she is. 
A cute nose that I want to pinch. A squishy and soft cheeks that I always want to squeeze. 
A soul that is very caring, very beautiful, and very precious.
<br>
<br>
For my precious girl, I'm looking forward to enjoying and making our moments together. 
I hope we make this year so special and memorable. Always remember that I will always love you even at my lowest. 

Happiest New Yearrr, Sam!!!

Hii Babiii
<br>
<br>
Do you still remember the days where we don't even interact with each other? Do you still remember the first time you hugged me because of the letter I gave you?
Do you still remember the time when we didn't notice that we were holding hands? Do you still remember how we confessed to each other? I hope you still remember all of that.
<br>
<br>
The first day that I saw you, I immediately feel an aura, an aura that certainly shine throughout the room. I was observing you, thinking of what you have and why you have that very striking aura.
That's why I told arnie that you would be the president of the class, but you became a secretary, close enough. I even stalked you and remembered your name on that first day, that was the day that I finally meet my one and only babii.
<br>
<br>
I still can't believe that we are so close together few weeks after our first day. So, that's why I wrote you a letter for your birthday. That was the first time I wrote someone a letter for their birthday.
I thought that you wouldn't cry when I gave you the letter, I'm surprised you did. When you hugged me, I felt a different aura, an aura that I am so confused of. When you hugged me a felt a different person, it's like the world stopped when you hugged me.
I was so confused on why that happened but it was my first time so i thought maybe everyone did that.
<br>
<br>
We were very close friends months after we met, this was the month that I began to understand that I have feelings for you. The moment we hold hands together when we're just playing our hands, we didn't even mentioned about why we're holding hands.
Day by day I feel even harder, I didn't even realized that we hold our hands together everytime we get a chance. It's like we were very comfortable with each other that we hold our hands together to show that we care.
<br>
<br>
I remembered telling arnie that I like you, she was even shocked and shipped us together hehe. I didn't confess when I told her that because I'm afraid that I'll just get rejected.
The night that we rejected to each other, you are giving clues on who's your crush. When you told arnie through pm that I am your crush, she immediately messaged me saying "omg".
And then, it's my turn to guess who's your crush. I wasn't expecting you to answer me and I kept asking obvious questions that describes me. I was afraid that you'll deny that I'm your crush so I kept asking questions until I finally asked "AKO BA YAN?".

Hii Babiii
<br>
<br>
Happy Valentine's Day! Time flies so fast, right? I still remember the first day that we confessed to each other, the first day I gave you gifts, and the first day that I courted you.
Many days have passed and each day I fell even harder. My love for you grew like a flower. Week by week I began to see the true meaning of love.
After many months of knowing you, I did not regret choosing you. Why? Because you were different.
<br>
<br>
You made me experience how is it like to have a highschool love. You made me experience how to court someone since it was my first time.
You made me experience how to love and to be loved genuinely. You made me realize how to treat a precious girl like you, the precious girl that I deeply love.
You deserve the world babii, you're so beautiful.
<br>
<br>
You made me experience how to be myself. How to enjoy, socialize, and be confident. You taught me how to stand up on my own.
You made me realize that life is short, why not enjoy it? I'm so thankful that you made me realize all those things. I'm so happy that I get to experience all of that all because of you.
Not only you were there when I felt down and sad, you also listened to my rants which really helped in finding myself. I can't imagine how it's like when I didn't met you.
<br>
<br>
I don't know how you can tolerate me even though I'm noisy and disturbing. I don't know how you can lift up my mood whenever I'm sad and felt like the world was against me. At the end of the day, You are there whenever I need someone to cling to and all I need is your presence, then I'm okay.
Always remember that whenever you're happy, I'm happy too. I'm so grateful that god me the chance to spend more time with you. I love you so much my secretary and babi! mwaa!
<br>
<br>
I love you so much, I'll never get tired saying that. If you want every second I will say I love you to you. Words can't express how deeply I am inlove with you.
If only we see each other everyday, I will hug you everytime. I love youuu so muchh babiiiiiiiiiii!!!
